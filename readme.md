# Question 1: Plaintext Editing

_This is our frontend coding challenge. It gives us a chance to see your abilities and how you approach problems. It is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution. Feel free to use any packages/tools/etc. you'd like to edit text as elegantly as possible. There are a variety of different file types to experiment with as you see fit._

## At the 1 hour limit

_(disclaimer: I may have gone a bit over the 1 hr limit while writing this readme, but did not continue to work on the code)_

- What has been implemented:

  - Plain text files appear in an input field (something like a textarea would be better for longer texts).
  - The input field is responsive and updates the value (the file text).
  - Submitting the new text calls the write function, passing it the new text value.

- Where I would go next:
  - Editing does not need to be the default. The user should be able to activate the editing option, but otherwise be able to simply view the file as it is.
  - Implement the write function so that the updated value of the file (the text itself) would be written the the file array.
    - This probably means the text value of the file should be updated in the editor and then passed as a whole object to the write function.

## Overtime

_After an additional 20 minutes:_

- The plain text editor works! You can edit the text of a plain text file and save it.

### Learning Already!

_**Confession:** There was a lot in these files that was new to me._ There are some things that are completely new to me and some that I have only recently started to learn about. Working with this code base has already given me an opportunity to learn and grow!

I realize that I did not implement very much because I spent most of the hour researching and reading docs. I am going to create a new branch (so that I can preserve what I was able to accomplish in an hour) and I will work on this tomorrow so that I can continue to familiarize myself with the all of the new materials and tools. I will continue to work on this until I have implemented all of the features.

## Super Overtime

_No time limit, just playing around to implement additional features._
